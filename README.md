# Learning ReactJS

This repository contains my understanding of ReactJS and example react scripts as part of my learning journey. 

## What is React
- React is one of the most popular development framework for Single Page Applications (SPAs).
- It was developed by Facebook. But now its used by lot of big techs out there.

## Why React
- It provides innovative way to solve traditional problems with Single page applications as below - 
    - Automatic UI State Management
    - Lightning fast DOM Manipulation
        - Provides virtual DOM which later gets synched to actual DOM as an when needed. This process is called Reconciliation.
    - Provides great API to develop and manage UI reusable components.
    - View through JavaScript
        - Provides power of javascript to define our view
        - Its called JSX (JavaScript XML)
- Basically React addresses V(view) component in the MVC architecture.

## JSX
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. 
- It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is often used with the React library to describe what the UI should look like. 
- By using JSX, you can write HTML structures in the same file as your JavaScript code, making the code easier to understand and develop 

## Babel Script
- Converts JSX into plain HTML & JavaScript that browser can understand
- This is included in React scripts
